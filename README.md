# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction â€“ Telco Dataset

This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using Python (pandas, sklearn, SQL), Power BI, and various machine learning models. The goal is to identify customers likely to churn and understand the key drivers behind their behavior.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: Telco Customer Churn dataset (CSV)
- **Size**: 7,043 rows, 21 columns
- **Target variable**: `Churn` (Yes/No)

---

## ðŸ§  Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
   - Handled missing values, duplicates
   - Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric
   - Explored churn patterns with SQL and Python

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Scaled numerical features
   - Addressed class imbalance with `class_weight` and hyperparameters

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trained 7 models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, MLP
   - Applied **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV
   - Created a **Voting Ensemble**
   - Final model: **CatBoostClassifier**

4. **Performance Metrics (Class 1: Churn)**

| Model            | F1-Score |
|------------------|----------|
| âœ… **CatBoost**     | **0.615**  
| Voting Ensemble  | 0.610  
| Random Forest    | 0.605  
| XGBoost          | 0.603  
| Decision Tree    | 0.597  

5. **Dashboard & Business Insights**
   - Created interactive Power BI dashboard
   - Identified churn patterns by contract, tenure, charges
   - Estimated revenue loss by customer segment

---

## ðŸš€ Final Model: CatBoost

```python
CatBoostClassifier(learning_rate=0.05, iterations=200, depth=5, class_weights=[1,2])
```

### ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard Summary

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive overview of customer churn patterns in the Telco dataset. It highlights:

- Total and churned customers
- Churn rates by gender, contract type, senior status, and more
- Revenue lost due to churn
- Slicers for segment-level filtering

Business insights such as higher churn among month-to-month contracts, senior citizens, and streaming service users are clearly visualized. This complements the machine learning analysis done in Python.
